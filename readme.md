# About me: 

My name is Caitlin Tefft.  I am in my final semester in the iSchool in the [Data/Information Management and Analytics](https://ischool.wisc.edu/current-students/masters-degree-program/concentrations/datainformation-management-analytics/) concentration.  I am particularly interested in working with qualitative data and using compuational methods to aid qualitative analysis.

## Academic/Professional Interests
1. Social sciences
2. Qualitative research
3. Research computing
4. CAQDAS

## Tools I Am Excited to Use in Class
I am most excited to continue using Python to manage and analyze data.  I have been working with Python for just over 6 months and am finally starting to feel comfortable in the language but have a lot to learn and am excited to get more practice as I believe it will be professionally very useful to have a strong foundation in the language.
